This repository apply the U-Net on the KITTI semantic segementation dataset. The GitHub action works well, but it does not store and write the folder to generate semantic segmentation images. If you would like to do pull request, could you please download the train image, train semantic, test images and hdf5 file to see the entire thing and modify the code, the datasets are small.
